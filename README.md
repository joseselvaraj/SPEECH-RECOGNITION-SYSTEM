Task Title: Speech Recognition System

Task Summary:

As per the instructions, I have developed a Python-based Speech Recognition System to convert speech into text in real time or from audio files.

Files Included:

main.py:
This is the main Python script which:

Listens for speech from the microphone or reads from an audio file

Converts the spoken content to text using the speech_recognition library

Saves the transcribed text to an output file

audio.wav

An example audio file used for testing the transcription system.

output.txt

The generated output file which contains:

Transcribed Text from the provided audio input

Tools & Technologies Used:

Language: Python

Libraries:

speech_recognition

pyaudio (for live microphone input)

wave (for reading .wav files)

Features:

Converts speech to text from:

Microphone input

Pre-recorded audio files (WAV format, PCM encoding)

Saves transcription to a .txt file automatically

User-friendly console interface

Notes:

Audio files must be in PCM WAV format for compatibility with the speech_recognition library.

Online tools like Online Audio Converter can be used to convert audio formats correctly.

Thank you for the opportunity!

Warm regards,
