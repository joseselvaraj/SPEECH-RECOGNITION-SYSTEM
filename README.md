# 🎤 Speech to Text Project

This is a basic speech-to-text converter using Python. It transcribes speech from `.wav` audio files into text using the `speech_recognition` library.

## 📁 Folder Structure

speech_to_text/
├── main.py # Python script for speech recognition
├── audio.wav # Input audio file
├── output.txt # Generated transcript (created after run)
├── README.md # Project description and instructions

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure `audio.wav` is in the folder.
2. Open terminal in this folder.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py

### ✅ STEP 4: Add Requirements (Optional)

Create a `requirements.txt` (if you haven't):
